        <h3>
            Atletico Madrid welcome back Griezmann from Barcelona
        </h3>

        <p>
            France forward Antoine Griezmann has made a shock return to Atletico Madrid just two years after leaving to
            join Barcelona, on the final day of a hectic European transfer window.

            Real Madrid also bagged a French international star as Eduardo Camavinga arrived from Rennes — but their
            attempts to sign Kylian Mbappe from Paris Saint-Germain failed.

            World Cup-winning 30-year-old Griezmann, who scored 133 goals in his first spell with Atletico, has rejoined
            on a one-year loan deal with an option to extend by another year and an obligation to buy, the club said.

            “Welcome back, Griezmann!” Atletico wrote on its website. <br><br>

            Barcelona have been struggling financially and had to allow six-time Ballon d’Or winner Lionel Messi to
            leave for PSG last month.

            Midfield prodigy Camavinga, who is just 18, penned a six-year deal at Real, the club reportedly paying a fee
            of 31 million euros ($36.6m) plus nine million euros more in bonuses.

            It is a considerable sum for the Angolan-born player, who was in the final year of his contract at Rennes.
            Real had spent the last week trying to clinch a dizzying deal for 22-year-old forward Mbappe, making two
            bids, the last understood to be worth a total of 180 million euros.

            But PSG’s Qatari owners do not need to sell and appear prepared to risk losing Mbappe for free at the end of
            the campaign in order to have the World Cup winner, Neymar and Messi together in attack for at least one
            season.

            Real can come back in for Mbappe again in January, when they could sign him to a pre-contract agreement to
            move next summer without having to pay a transfer fee.

            It has been an extraordinary summer transfer window in Europe, with Messi departing Barcelona for Paris and
            Cristiano Ronaldo on Tuesday finalising his sensational return to Manchester United from Juventus.

            Apart from Messi, PSG have also signed Sergio Ramos from Real Madrid and one of the world’s top goalkeepers,
            Gianluigi Donnarumma, from AC Milan.

            They also strengthened their midfield with Georginio Wijnaldum from Liverpool and signed flying Morocco
            right-back Achraf Hakimi, who shone for Inter Milan last season.

            The latter cost some 60 million euros, with the rest all arriving as free agents. <br><br>


            On Tuesday, the club also announced the signing of teenage Portugal defender Nuno Mendes from Sporting
            Lisbon, on a season-long loan with an option to buy.

            Ronaldo is the latest big-money signing in the Premier League, where the biggest deals have seen Manchester
            City buy Jack Grealish from Aston Villa for £100 million ($138m) and Romelu Lukaku return to Chelsea from
            Inter for £97.5 million.

            – Belts tightened -In contrast, PSG apart, leading clubs on the continent have not been as willing to spend
            big money as they continue to suffer from the economic impact of the pandemic.

            Before adding Camavinga, Real’s only signing of note was David Alaba on a free from Bayern Munich. <br><br>

            Barcelona, mired in huge debts, could not keep Messi and spent deadline day selling off some of their
            talented youngsters.

            Brazilian right-back Emerson Royal joined Tottenham Hotspur for 25 million euros after two seasons on loan
            with Real Betis, while teenager Ilaix Moriba headed to RB Leipzig for an initial 16 million euros.

            Their only new permanent signings have been free agents, Eric Garcia and Sergio Aguero from Manchester City
            and Memphis Depay from Lyon.

            They also announced a deadline-day deal to take Sevilla forward Luuk de Jong on loan. <br><br>

            In the Premier League, Chelsea secured the signing of Atletico midfielder Saul Niguez on a season-long loan,
            while Leeds signed Wales winger Dan James from Manchester United in a deal worth a reported £25 million
            ($34.3 million).

            Early strugglers Arsenal signed Japan defender Takehiro Tomiyasu from Bologna for a fee worth a reported
            £19.8 million, and offloaded defender Hector Bellerin to Real Betis on a season-long loan.

            In Italy, champions Inter replaced Lukaku and Hakimi with cheaper alternatives in Edin Dzeko and Netherlands
            right-back Denzel Dumfries.

            They also signed Argentina’s Joaquin Correa from Lazio on an initial one-year loan. <br><br>

            Juventus offloaded Ronaldo and signed two Italy internationals in striker Moise Kean and midfielder Manuel
            Locatelli.

            Both arrived on loans that will become permanent after two years, a way for Juve to spread out the payments
            to Everton and Sassuolo respectively.

            In Germany, Bayern Munich splashed a total of 67.5 million euros signing France defender Dayot Upamecano and
            Austria’s Marcel Sabitzer from RB Leipzig.

            Borussia Dortmund bought Dutch forward Donyell Malen from PSV Eindhoven and, crucially, have kept hold of
            Erling Haaland.

        <h3>Official: Atletico Madrid sign Matheus Cunha</h3>

        <p>
            Atletico Madrid have confirmed the signing of Matheus Cunha from Hertha Berlin, as Los Colchoneros' search
            for a forward finally comes to an end.

            The 22-year-old may not be in the mould of Luis Suarez, instead having a playing style more similar to that
            of Angel Correa, but he has been brought to Atletico to complete Diego Simeone's attack.

            His arrival comes after Atletico failed to reach an agreement with Fiorentina for Dusan Vlahovic, who is
            more of a typical No.9. Earlier in the summer Los Colchoneros had also tried to see if they could tempt
            Antoine Griezmann away from Barcelona, but no agreement was reached. <br><br>
            Cunha left Brazil at the age of 18 as he joined Swiss side Sion, but he didn't stay there for long as his
            performances caught the eye of RB Leipzig, who paid 15 million euros for his services.

            After a season and a half at Leipzig, Cunha made the switch to Hertha for a fee of 18 million euros. Now,
            another 18 months later, he has completed a move to Atletico Madrid.

            Cunha may not be a prolific goalscorer, but his numbers are not bad. Ignoring his time at Leipzig, where he
            barely played, he found the back of the net five times in 11 games in his first season at Hertha. He
            followed that up with a return of seven goals and five assists last season. <br><br>

        </p>

        <h3>
            Welcome Cunha!
        </h3>
        <p>
            We are very exited in this signing, Cunha has showed great talent and we believe that he will come to do
            great things at Atletico Madrid!
        </p>

        <h3>
            Cunhas increadible skills and goals!

        <h3>Chelsea sign Atletico Madrid's Saul Niguez on season-long loan</h3>
        <p>
            Chelsea have confirmed the signing of Atletico Madrid’s Saul Niguez on a season-long loan with the option to
            buy.

            The 26-year-old midfielder is under contract at Atletico until 2026.

            Saul's arrival makes him Chelsea's final signing of the window. <br> <br>

            On switching to London, Saul said: "I am very excited to start this new challenge with Chelsea. Blues fans,
            I am one of you now and I can’t wait to wear the shirt, start training and see all of you. See you soon!"

            Saul has fallen down the pecking order at Atletico. He played 33 games last season as Atletico won La Liga,
            scoring two goals. But Diego Simeone's side have signed Rodrigo de Paul this summer, who plays in central
            midfield. He started the club's opening two La Liga games this campaign but was dropped to the bench for
            their recent 2-2 draw against Villarreal, appearing as a second-half substitute. <br> <br>

            He broke through at Atletico, making his first-team debut for the club against Besiktas in March 2012. He
            has played 230 times for them in the league, scoring 26 goals.

            During his time in the first-team, Atletico have won La Liga, the Copa del Rey, the Europa League twice and
            the UEFA Super Cup. They also finished as runners-up in the Champions League final in 2015-16.

            Saul has also picked up 19 senior Spain caps.
        </p>
        <H3>
            We wish Saul the best of luck with Chelsea, you will be missed!
        </H3>
        <p>

            Heres a compilation of all Sauls 43 goals during his time at Atletico Madrid!
